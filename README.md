I had alone done all things including deployment optimisation

Steps -
1. open the code in vs code

2.Check if the input test file is already given in code like this 
string filename = "input.txt";

Then use the required test case like enron.txt or skitter.txt 
Compile command                   g++ -O2 -std=c++17 file_name.cpp -o file_name
Output command                             ./file_name

3.if testcase name is not in the code  then use the following command
Compile command                   g++ -O2 -std=c++17 file_name.cpp -o file_name
Output command                             ./file_name testcase.txt

NOTE IN THE TEST CASE ONLY INCLUDE THE NUMBERS MEANS REMOVE ANY COMMENT AND 
IT SHOULD BE LOOK LIKE
HERE N IS THE NUMBER OF VERTICES AND M IS THE NUMBER OF EDGE CASES.

EXAMPLE
